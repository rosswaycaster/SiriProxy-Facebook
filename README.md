# Obtaining auth info

I have created a Facebook app that will give you your Access_Token and username with the correct permissions.

All you have to do is go to ~~http://siri.rosswaycaster.com~~ and follow the directions. None of your information is stored or shared. If you know how to set up your own Facebook app feel free to do so and get a access_token from there.
